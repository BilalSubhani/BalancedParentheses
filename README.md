# BalancedParentheses

This function takes a string s as input and checks whether the input string represents a valid sequence of parentheses, brackets, and braces.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes a multimap named myMultimap to store the counts of opening parentheses, brackets, and braces. <br>
2. It iterates through each character of the input string s. <br>
3. If the character is a closing parenthesis, bracket, or brace (')', ']', or '}'), it decreases the count of the corresponding opening character in the multimap. <br>
4. If the character is an opening parenthesis, bracket, or brace ('(', '[', or '{'), it increases the count of that character in the multimap. <br>
5. After processing all characters, if the counts in the multimap indicate that there are unmatched opening characters, the function returns false, indicating that the input string is not valid. <br>
5. If all opening characters have matching closing characters, the function returns true, indicating that the input string is valid.

Overall, the function checks if the input string contains a balanced sequence of parentheses, brackets, and braces. If it does, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
